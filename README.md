# DLA-VPS (Visualization)


## Introduction

This work proposes a deep-learning-assisted visual analysis system, which utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN) to emulate [Nyx](https://amrex-astro.github.io/Nyx/) 
simulation and conduct efficient data exploration and analysis. Nyx is a widely used cosmological simulation developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

The trained model acts as the backend analysis framework, facilitating various visual interactions and analysis activities in the system.
